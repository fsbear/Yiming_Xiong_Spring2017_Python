But though her life appeared to be charmed, with a 20-year marriage to Laurence Olivier and two best actress Oscars, she battled bipolar disorder and eventually died of tuberculosis at 53. This 15-film tribute, shown on Tuesdays in September, begins with ''Vivien Leigh: Scarlett and Beyond,'' Gene Feldman and Suzette Winter's 1990 documentary, featuring archival footage of Leigh addressing British troops during World War II and relaxing with Olivier at their country estate. The evening continues with ''Dark Journey'' (1937), at 9, starring Leigh in her first leading role, as a French spy who falls for her German counterpart (Conrad Veidt); the screwball comedy ''Storm in a Teacup'' (1937), at 10:30, in which she plays a headstrong heiress tamed by love; and ''St. Martin's Lane'' (1940), at midnight, about a street performer (Charles Laughton) who helps an enticing pickpocket (Leigh) forge a new career as a dancer. That film, originally released in 1938 as ''Sidewalks of London,'' was Leigh's final steppingstone to winning the role of Scarlett O'Hara opposite Clark Gable in ''Gone With the Wind'' (1939). 8 P.M.

(Random House, $12.95.) Talk about a rough spell: first, the author's declining father is shipped across the country to live with her in upstate New York. Then her husband abandons her and their baby, leaving Cohen to make do as caretaker of this unlikely pair, a struggle she handles without self-pity and with the help of neighbors and colleagues. Her simply spun memoir, originally published as ''The House on Beartown Road,'' is ''frank, funny and unexploitative,'' Maggie Jones said here last year. SECRET EMPIRE: Eisenhower, the CIA, and the Hidden Story of America's Space Espionage, by Philip Taubman. (Simon & Schuster, $15.) The author, a longtime correspondent for The Times and now its Washington bureau chief, chronicles the advent of aerial and space-based reconnaissance, which allowed the United States to move through the cold war with confidence as it tracked the limited military assets of the Soviets. ''Taubman tells this story with effervescent admiration for the heroic inventors and a fine eye for revealing anecdotes,'' Alex Roland wrote here in 2003. AMERICAN HUMOR: A Study of the National Character, by Constance Rourke. (New York Review, $14.) This classic 1931 survey of early American humor and mythmaking identifies several cultural archetypes -- the Yankee peddler, the buckskin-clad backwoodsman and the minstrel in blackface -- and traces them through native literature and popular entertainment. Our reviewer, R. L. Duffus, said that ''Rourke's admirably thought out book is of first-rate importance because it indicates how rich in potentiality'' the nation's reservoir of traditional culture is. THE WINTER QUEEN, by Boris Akunin. (Random House, $12.95.) Wildly popular in Russia, Akunin sets his mysteries in czarist times, and writes them in a tongue-in-cheek 19th-century style. This one features a detective called ''our hero'' who begins his career by investigating the death of a rich young Muscovite, who apparently did himself in with a pistol during a game of ''American roulette.'' The result is ''a saucy and insouciant tale of derringers and derring-do,'' Richard Lourie said in these pages last year. ''If Pushkin had tried his hand at detective fiction, it might have turned out something like this.'' THE OTHER SIDE OF SILENCE, by Andr\u00e9 Brink. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) The South African writer explores the horrors of colonialism through the eyes of an unlikely victim: Hanna X, a German woman who seeks her freedom in the new colony of German Southwest Africa (now Namibia), but meets with terrible violence and mutilation. Last year our reviewer, Ruth Franklin, said that at its best, this ''is a novel of unforgettable power,'' and that ''it is testimony to Brink's novelistic skill that Hanna's pain is so vivid.'' LOST IN A GOOD BOOK, by Jasper Fforde. (Penguin, $14.) In the second installment in the adventures of the literary detective Thursday Next (introduced in ''The Eyre Affair''), Next again uses a machine called a ''prose portal'' to penetrate a work of literature -- in this case, Poe's poem ''The Raven,'' where she tries to liberate a minor villain and save the world from turning into a pink, gooey substance. ''Immensely enjoyable,'' the tale resembles ''an analogue of Harry Potter just for adults . . . brainy enough to feel like proper reading'' but as ''unashamedly escapist as the best children's fiction,'' Bruno Maddox said here last year. THE ETHICS OF MEMORY, by Avishai Margalit. (Harvard University, $14.95.) A philosophy professor examines the power of moral emotions, using Jewish memories of the Holocaust, for instance, to argue that forgiveness does not require forgetting a wrong but requires getting beyond certain emotions like humiliation and resentment. ''Margalit is an astonishingly humane thinker,'' Jonathan Lear wrote here in 2003. ''His philosophy is always tied to making sense of us humans in all our complexity.'' THE EMPEROR'S BABE, by Bernardine Evaristo. (Penguin, $14.) This free-verse novel, composed mainly in unrhymed couplets, tells of a Sudanese immigrant girl growing up in third-century London, when it was a far western outpost of the Roman Empire. The London Evaristo creates ''is a rich farrago of historical fact and outrageous fancy, teeming with slaves, socialites and drag queens,'' Eric McHenry said here in 2002.
