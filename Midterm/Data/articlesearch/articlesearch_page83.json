The bulky Mustang GT's V-8 whined -- R.P.M.'s approaching 8,000 -- and at least two tires were screeching as their edges barely held the tarmac. I was hard on the clutch, hard on the brakes, hard on the motor. And that's how my instructors at the Bob Bondurant School of High-Performance Driving wanted it. Because auto racing, done properly, is brutal on a car. To work as a race mechanic is Sisyphean. Professional teams rebuild their engines nearly every weekend, and Bondurant employs a crew of technicians to constantly replace the parts ruined by hacks like me. You might hesitate to run third gear to the redline in your Volvo, but there's little reason to worry at Bondurant. As one instructor put it, while my class coughed inside a cloud of atomized tire rubber, ''You're here to push the limits of the car.''", "subsection_name": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/magazine/05play_017_.html", "abstract": "Josh Dean Master Class column discusses driving schools that offer experiences behind racecars; photo (M)", "snippet": "Learning to find the apex of a turn while heel-toe downshifting at high-performance driving school....", "headline": {"kicker": "Master Class", "main": "Pedal-to-the-Metal 101"}, "type_of_material": "News", "keywords": [{"value": "AUTOMOBILE RACING", "name": "subject"}], "_id": "4fd24fd68eb7c8105d7f2dc6", "word_count": 725}, {"pub_date": "2011-03-27T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Job Market", "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"person": [{"rank": 1, "role": "reported", "firstname": "Phyllis", "lastname": "KORKKI", "organization": ""}], "contributor": "", "original": "By PHYLLIS KORKKI"}, "blog": [], "document_type": "article", "print_page": "9", "news_desk": "SundayBusiness", "multimedia": [{"width": 75, "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnailwidth": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2011/03/27/business/27search/27search-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "height": 75, "type": "image", "url": "images/2011/03/27/business/27search/27search-thumbStandard.jpg"}], "slideshow_credits": null, "lead_paragraph": "More employers are using internships as a recruiting tool.
