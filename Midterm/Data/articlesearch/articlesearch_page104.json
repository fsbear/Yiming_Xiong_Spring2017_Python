Wilco's breakthrough album, ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,'' was released in 2002, and its success birthed a small industry. There was ''I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,'' Sam Jones's reverent documentary. Greg Kot has just published ''Learning How to Die'' (Broadway Books), a loving biography of the band, and this fall the band is to release ''The Wilco Book,'' advertised as a ''visual analog to the band's music.'' Alan Light has named Wilco as one of the bands that inspired his new magazine, Tracks, devoted to ''Music Built to Last.'' (And aimed, one presumes, at listeners who already have.) Fans of Wilco's singer-songwriter, Jeff Tweedy, could keep busy with the self-titled 2003 album from his side project, Loose Fur, or his book of poetry, ''Adult Head,'' published earlier this year.
