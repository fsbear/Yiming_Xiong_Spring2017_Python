Their brains are more connected, more flexible and more active than they will ever be again. They already think abstractly, reason and draw the right conclusions from data. Take cause and effect. The conventional wisdom, going back to Piaget, had been that preschoolers were ''pre-causal'' thinkers. But studies now show that even toddlers are able to discover subtle and complex causal relationships. In our cognitive development lab at the University of California at Berkeley, 2- to 4-year-olds are given a machine with different combinations of gears and switches that make other gears go. The typical 4-year-old quickly figures out how it works, even where complicated reasoning is required -- the sort that sophisticated ''data mining'' computers use. The preschoolers performed these feats by carefully noting just what the machine does and when, by attentively watching what adults do to it and what happens as a result, and by playing with the machine themselves.", "subsection_name": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/education/edlife/EDSCIENCE.html", "abstract": "Article by Alison Gopnik, psychology professor, says schools do not teach the same way children learn; explains differences between what she terms guided discovery and routinized learning; photo (special section, Education Life) (M)", "snippet": "If toddlers can figure things out so easily, why can't schoolchildren?...", "headline": {"main": "How We Learn"}, "type_of_material": "News", "keywords": [{"value": "EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "READING AND WRITING SKILLS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "EDUCATION (PRE-SCHOOL)", "name": "subject"}], "_id": "4fd2809d8eb7c8105d84c363", "word_count": 1059}, {"pub_date": "2010-02-01T23:10:48Z", "section_name": "Technology", "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"person": [{"rank": 1, "role": "reported", "firstname": "Steve", "lastname": "LOHR", "organization": ""}], "original": "By STEVE LOHR"}, "blog": [], "document_type": "blogpost", "print_page": null, "news_desk": null, "multimedia": [], "slideshow_credits": null, "lead_paragraph": "Google, like other leading technology companies, funds university research in fields where its interest and the interest of science coincide.
