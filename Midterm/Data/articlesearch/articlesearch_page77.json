The scientists had clearly made a big leap along the road toward experiments that might help shed light on the characteristics of antimatter. But what a tiny step it was toward the nearly hopeless task of converting antimatter into a useful energy source or weapon. Antimatter has long fascinated researchers and science fiction writers because it is so rare and so strange. Antimatter is built up from particles that are mirror images of ordinary protons and electrons, behaving much the same but bearing opposite electric charges. When an antiparticle and a particle collide, both are annihilated in an explosion that, ounce for ounce, is the most powerful energy source known, dwarfing both nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. But harnessing that power is still in the realm of science fiction.", "subsection_name": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/opinion/don-t-beam-us-up-just-yet.html", "abstract": "Editorial on scientific announcement of breakthrough in production of antimatter, magical material that supposedly could whisk humans across galaxy at warp speed, a la Star Trek", "snippet": "Fans of futuristic ''Star Trek'' and military technologies could only shiver in anticipation last week when scientists announced a breakthrough in the production of antimatter, the magical material that could supposedly whisk us at warp speed acro...", "headline": {"main": "Don't Beam Us Up Just Yet"}, "type_of_material": "Editorial", "keywords": [{"value": "SPACE", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "EDITORIALS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "ANTIMATTER", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "PHYSICS", "name": "subject"}], "_id": "4fd222858eb7c8105d7a7e1e", "word_count": 477}, {"pub_date": "2016-09-29T20:32:50Z", "section_name": "Business Day", "source": "", "byline": {"person": [], "organization": "REUTERS", "original": "By REUTERS"}, "blog": [], "document_type": "article", "print_page": null, "news_desk": "None", "multimedia": [], "slideshow_credits": null, "lead_paragraph": "Alphabet Inc's Google said on Thursday it renamed its business-to-business cloud computing brand and enhanced some enterprise applications using artificial intelligence, the company's latest gambit to better compete with Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp. in the lucrative cloud business.
