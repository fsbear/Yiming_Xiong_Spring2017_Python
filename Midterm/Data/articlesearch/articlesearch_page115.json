The process of writing clarifies. The stark truth of black letters on a blank screen makes it hard to hide. I often set out in one direction and find that the words take me somewhere else, to a belief I didn't know I held. Bill Jensen feels this way about writing, too. He is a business consultant who specializes in simplifying workplaces. To do this, he has learned, he first has to clarify work itself for the people who are doing it. Not the particulars of working -- fill out this form, turn on this machine, fix this system -- but the reason for the work. So he asks provocative questions of employees: ''What is the single most important insight about work that you want to pass onto your kids? Why do we do what we wouldn't want our kids to do?
