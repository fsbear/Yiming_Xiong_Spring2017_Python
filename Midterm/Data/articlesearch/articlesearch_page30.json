That's the earth-shattering question at the heart of ''Wimbledon,'' a likable, formulaic sports movie that follows the miraculous comeback of an insecure 31-year-old British tennis pro, Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) whose career resurrects on the wings of love. In the eight years since Peter placed 11th in the international tennis rankings, he has sunk to 119th. At Wimbledon, where he's playing his last professional matches before taking a job as a tennis instructor at a fancy club, he meets and falls in love with an American tennis pro, Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst). A super-competitive athlete, on the fast track to the women's championship, Lizzie appears unstoppable until Paul enters her life. As her defenses start to crumble, her concentration falters and the trajectories of their careers unexpectedly reverse. Paul credits Lizzie with spurring his triumphs, while she bitterly blames him for her fall from grace.", "subsection_name": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/17/movies/17WIMB.html", "abstract": "Stephen Holden reviews movie Wimbledon, directed by Richard Loncraine and starring Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany; photo (M)", "snippet": "Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany star in this likable, formulaic sports movie about an insecure British tennis pro whose career resurrects on the wings of love....", "headline": {"kicker": "FILM REVIEW", "main": "Learning to Win at Love With a Center Court Rally"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "keywords": [{"value": "WIMBLEDON (MOVIE)", "name": "creative_works"}, {"value": "LONCRAINE, RICHARD", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "DUNST, KIRSTEN", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "BETTANY, PAUL", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "NEILL, SAM", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "MOTION PICTURES", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "REVIEWS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "WIMBLEDON TENNIS TOURNAMENT", "name": "subject"}], "_id": "4fd23e538eb7c8105d7d4a4a", "word_count": 835}, {"pub_date": "2003-04-09T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Education; New York and Region", "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"person": [{"rank": 1, "role": "reported", "firstname": "Michael", "lastname": "Winerip", "organization": ""}], "original": "By Michael Winerip"}, "blog": [], "document_type": "article", "print_page": "9", "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "multimedia": [], "slideshow_credits": null, "lead_paragraph": "HIS first two years at Long Beach High School, Wes Moran was going straight downhill.
